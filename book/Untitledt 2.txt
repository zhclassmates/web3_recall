Dear Twitter Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to submit an appeal regarding the suspension of my Twitter account [@zhaoxf2]. My account is registered with the email address 1183800652@qq.com.

**Background:** I recently discovered that my account has been suspended, and I am unsure of the specific reasons behind this action. My account has always been used personally by me, and I have never engaged in activities that violate Twitter's rules.

**Clarifications:**

1. **VPN Usage:** I am not certain if my account was flagged due to the use of a VPN. I use a VPN for security and privacy reasons, not to circumvent any of Twitter's policies.
2. **Following a Large Number of Users in a Short Time:** Due to my original Twitter account being suspended, I followed a large number of users in a short period to rebuild my social network.
3. **Content Viewing:** I have not viewed or interacted with any inappropriate content.
4. **Automated Bots:** I have never used any automated bots or third-party tools to interact with Twitter.

**Proof of Account Ownership:**

- My account registration email is 1183800652@qq.com.
- I can provide my recent activity records, such as the last login time and location.
- If needed, I can also provide some records of my interactions with followers on Twitter.

**Request:** I sincerely apologize if I have unintentionally violated any rules. I understand the importance of maintaining the integrity of the platform and am committed to adhering to Twitterâ€™s policies. I kindly request that you reconsider the suspension of my account. Rest assured, I will continue to engage with my followers in a respectful and rule-abiding manner.

**Contact Information:** Please feel free to reach out to me for any further information or clarification:
